# Nextra Theme Docs

**Nextra** is a framework on top of Next.js, that lets you build content focused
websites. It has all the great features from Next.js, plus extra power to create
Markdown-based content with ease.

## Quick Start

import { Card, Cards } from "@visulima/nextra-theme-docs";

To start using Nextra, you need to select a theme first:

<Cards num={2}>
    <Card arrow title="Documentation theme" href="/docs/docs-theme/start">
        <>![Documentation theme](/assets/nextra-theme-docs/docs-theme.png)</>
    </Card>
</Cards>
